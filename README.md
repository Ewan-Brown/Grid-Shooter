# ICS4U_FINAL
This is done in java with Graphics2D(soon to be OpenGl and multithreaded),
but still runs surprisingly fast(?blackmagic?). Try writing THIS in python you nerd.

My final project for grade 12 computer studies. Also my current biggest project
My biggest project behind the pixel physics game i made, but that was trash.

This was actually designed off of an old project i made that was just two teams of AI ships fighting 
eachother that i made to test AI and polygon clipping methods, which is in my 'Polygons' repo.

As of 5/1/2018 9:52 PM (A day before my IB math exam)

(FOR ANYONE WHO'D CARE):
1 external library, 23 classes, 2,103 lines, 7,303 words of pu'r Java. All mine except for one method to find the center of a polygon.

Everthing is drawn as polygons as i don't want to use images(to keep opportunity open for cool polygon animations[yeah right])

Polygon collisions are handled through a custom class that splits them into triangles using an ear split process, 

Multithreading is ready to happen and i'm excited but it's going to be disgusting. probably.


Current features:
-a player controlled ship
-2 kinds of enemies (2 more half made but i've been waiting to finish the framework to add those in)
-flexible ship/enemy design
-Particle effects (A handful implemented, many more unused as of yet)
-An intro screen with controls
-Zooming! (L/R arrows)
-Infinite procedural levels
-A score
-Procedural Upgrades as rewards 
-Reset everything on death
-Bullets and missiles

WIP:
-Better(more varied) upgrades
-Porting from Graphics2D to OpenGL 3/4 with JOGL Wrapper. <------ THIS IS THE BIG ONE (Testing for this is located in my OpenGlShips repo)
-Some more particle effects
-Multithreaded

Planned:
-More ships + a player ship selection
-An intro screen with settings (And with ship selection)
-A pointshop? (cosmetic? it is supposed to be a hardmode game)
-Many more enemies
-Way too many effects
