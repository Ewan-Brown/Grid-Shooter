# ICS4U_FINAL
This is done in java with Graphics2D

My final project for grade 12 computer studies. Also my current biggest project

This was actually designed off of an old project i made that was just two teams of AI ships fighting 
eachother that i made to test AI and polygon clipping methods, which is in my 'Polygons' repo.

As of 5/1/2018 9:52 PM (A day before my IB math exam)

Only code not written by me was a centroid algorithm

Everthing is drawn as polygons as i don't want to use images(to keep opportunity open for cool polygon animations[yeah right])

Polygon collisions are handled through a custom class that splits them into triangles using an ear split process, 

Multithreading is ready to happen and i'm excited but it's going to be disgusting. probably.


Current features:
-a player controlled ship
-2 kinds of enemies 
-flexible ship/enemy design
-Particle effects
-An intro screen with controls
-Zooming! (L/R arrows)
-Infinite procedural levels
-A score
-Procedural Upgrades as rewards 
-Bullets and missiles

WIP:
-Better(more varied) upgrades
-Porting from Graphics2D to OpenGL 3/4 with JOGL Wrapper. <------ THIS IS THE BIG ONE (Testing for this is located in my OpenGlShips repo)
-Some more particle effects
-Multithreaded

Planned:
-More ships + a player ship selection
-An intro screen with settings (And with ship selection)
-A pointshop? (cosmetic? it is supposed to be a hardmode game)
